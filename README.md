# RVFV_NERCproposal
Power analysis by simulation for sample size estimations

This repository contains the code used to assess the sample sizes required for the RVFV grant proposal submitted to the NERC Highlight Topics call. The simulations to estimate power for a given sample size use functions from [Power analysis for generalized linear mixed models in ecology and evolution](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12306).

There are three R files. The first file is for [mosquito sampling to estimate abundance](r_mozAbundanceSampling.R), the second is for [mosquito sampling to estimate blood feeding behaviour](r_mozBloodmealSampling.R) and the third is for [livestock serosurvey](r_livestockSampling.R).
